# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking

Title: Real Time Bus Tracking

Description: This project tracks bus locations for MBTA in real time. It first querys the MBTA API for the information and then posts the location to a google map. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download and then signup for your own google maps API key. You will need to add that to the HTML file. Then drag and drop on browser. 

Future improvements: I would like to figure out how to use this for other cities.
